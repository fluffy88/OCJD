 * The <code>DataClassTest</code> tests the main functionalities of the {@link Data} class. In order to simulate several clients trying to
 * use it and exercise the locking mechanism, it also has several inner classes that extend the {@link Thread} class, where each class
 * represents one client requesting one operation, and mainly requesting updating and deletion of records. The
 * <code>FindingRecordsThread</code> exercises two functionalities: finding records and reading records.
